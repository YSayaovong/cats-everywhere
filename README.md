# Cats Everywhere üê±

This project is a simple Python program to demonstrate basic class implementation, object instantiation, and usage of functions to manipulate those objects.

## Overview

The program creates a `Cat` class, instantiates multiple cat objects, and finds the oldest cat among them. This project is ideal for learning basic object-oriented programming concepts in Python, such as:

- Creating classes and methods
- Instantiating objects
- Using functions to process class instances

## Features

- **Cat Class**: Represents a cat, containing attributes like `name` and `age`.
- **Object Instantiation**: Creates multiple instances of cats with different ages.
- **Find Oldest Cat**: A function that determines which cat is the oldest and prints the result.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or copy the code from `main.py`.
3. Run the program using the following command:

   ```sh
   python main.py
